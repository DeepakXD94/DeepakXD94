Hi, I am Deepak, a Mechanical Engineer who is interested in coding and Data Analysis. 

I use GitHub as a warehouse to store and showcase my projects. My background inspires me to come up with non-conventional problems and solutions for those problems. 

You will find me an intermediate level coder who is trying to hone-up his skills ny working on new projects and expanding my knowledge of things.
