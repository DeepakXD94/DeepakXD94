Hi, I am Deepak, a Mechanical Engineer who is interested in coding and Data Analysis. 

I use GitHub as a warehouse to store my projects. My background inspires me to come up with non-conventional problems and solutions for those problems. 

You will find me an intermediate level coder who is trying to hone-up his skills through constant practise and expanding my knowledge of things.
